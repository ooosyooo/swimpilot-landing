## Project Overview

**SwimPilot Landing Page** - A multilingual static website for the SwimPilot swimming app. This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project with no build system or framework dependencies.

## Project Structure

This is a static landing page with language detection and routing:

- `index.html` - Entry point with automatic language detection and redirect logic
- `{lang}.html` - 10 language-specific landing pages (en, ko, ja, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, es, fr, de, ru, pt)
- No build tools, package managers, or frameworks

## Language System

### Supported Languages
The site supports 10 languages with automatic browser detection:
- English (en)
- Korean (ko)
- Japanese (ja)
- Chinese Simplified (zh-Hans) - default for Chinese
- Chinese Traditional (zh-Hant)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Russian (ru)
- Portuguese (pt)

### Language Detection Logic
`index.html` detects browser language via `navigator.language` and redirects to the appropriate localized page. Chinese variants are handled specially with mappings for regions (CN→Hans, TW/HK/MO→Hant). Default fallback is English.

## Architecture

### Single-File Architecture
Each language file is completely self-contained with:
- Inline CSS in `<style>` tags
- Inline JavaScript in `<script>` tags
- No external dependencies except Google Fonts (Noto Sans)

### Page Structure
All language pages follow the same 8-section structure:
1. **Hero** - Brand introduction with depth metaphor
2. **Philosophy** - Core swimming philosophy (silence, depth)
3. **Watch** - Apple Watch tracking features
4. **Journey** - Swimmer progression system (starting with "Nereid")
5. **Classes** - 13 depth levels (Proteus, Poseidon, Tiamat, etc.)
6. **Growth** - Personal progress tracking
7. **Manifesto** - Brand philosophy ("Beautiful because it has no end")
8. **Footer** - App Store link and copyright

### Animation System
Each section has unique visual effects created via JavaScript:
- **Animations**: Light particles, depth layers, silence trails, sinking lights, breath flows, change waves, watch ticks, pulse rings
- **Scroll Effects**: Line-by-line opacity/focus based on distance from viewport center
- **Section-Specific Animations**: Different animation combinations per section via `createAnimationsForSection()`
- **Performance**: Uses IntersectionObserver and requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Ocean depth gradient from dark blue (#0a1828) to light blue (#d0e8f2) back to dark
- **Typography**: Noto Sans (supports international characters), 3 text sizes (small, medium/large, emphasis)
- **Responsive**: clamp() CSS for fluid typography and spacing across devices

## Development

### Testing Changes
Simply open the HTML files directly in a browser - no server required. To test language detection, modify browser language settings or directly open specific language files.

### Adding/Modifying Content
1. Edit text content in the `.line` paragraph elements within each section
2. Maintain the class structure: `small`, `medium`, `large`, `emphasis` for sizing
3. Use `paragraph-break` class for vertical spacing between text groups
4. Keep changes synchronized across all 10 language files

### Modifying Animations
Animation creation happens in the JavaScript section:
- `initSectionAnimations()` - Sets up observers and containers
- `createAnimationsForSection()` - Assigns animation types per section
- Individual `create*()` functions - Generate specific animation elements

### App Store Link
Update the App Store URL in the footer `<a href>` tag:
```html
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/swimpilot" class="app-store-button" target="_blank">
```

## Deployment

This is a static site - simply upload all HTML files to any web server or hosting platform. Ensure:
- All 11 HTML files are in the same directory
- `index.html` is set as the default document
- No server-side configuration needed
